# ADR-001: Monolith-First Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - January 2025

## Context

The Island Traffic Authority Driver Integrated Administration System requires a robust, scalable architecture that can support complex driver licensing workflows while maintaining development velocity and operational simplicity. We need to choose between starting with a microservices architecture or a monolithic approach.

## Decision Drivers

- **Development Team Size**: Small initial team (2-5 developers)
- **Domain Complexity**: Well-defined but interconnected business domains
- **Time to Market**: Need to deliver MVP quickly
- **Operational Expertise**: Limited DevOps and distributed systems experience initially
- **Scalability Requirements**: Moderate initial load with potential for high growth
- **Future Flexibility**: Need ability to scale team and system architecture

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Microservices from Day 1
**Pros:**
- Immediate service isolation and independence
- Team autonomy once multiple teams exist
- Technology diversity possible
- Independent scaling of services

**Cons:**
- High operational complexity from start
- Distributed system complexity (network calls, data consistency)
- Over-engineering for current team size
- Difficult debugging and testing
- Premature optimization without understanding domain boundaries

### Option 2: Modular Monolith
**Pros:**
- Single deployment and operational model
- Simplified development and debugging
- Easier testing and integration
- Clear module boundaries prepare for future extraction
- Faster initial development velocity
- Better performance (no network overhead between modules)

**Cons:**
- Single point of failure
- All modules must use same technology stack
- Potential for tight coupling if not disciplined
- Scaling limitations at high volume

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Pros:**
- Start monolith, extract services as needed
- Gradual complexity increase
- Learn domain boundaries before splitting

**Cons:**
- Requires disciplined module design
- Risk of delaying necessary splits

## Decision

**Chosen Option: Modular Monolith (Option 2 with evolution path to Option 3)**

We will implement a monolithic architecture with clearly defined module boundaries that can be extracted into microservices when business needs justify the additional complexity.

## Rationale

1. **Team Size Alignment**: Our small initial team can work more effectively on a monolith
2. **Domain Learning**: We need to understand the actual usage patterns and domain boundaries before splitting
3. **Operational Simplicity**: Single deployment model reduces operational overhead
4. **Performance**: No network latency between business logic components
5. **Development Velocity**: Faster initial development and easier debugging
6. **Future Path**: Well-designed modules can be extracted when team grows or scaling demands it

## Implementation Details

### Module Structure
```
app/
├── modules/
│   ├── identity/       # Authentication & user management
│   ├── calendar/       # Scheduling & appointments  
│   ├── receipt/        # Payments & financial records
│   ├── registration/   # Driver applications & processing
│   ├── test_engine/    # Testing & assessment workflows
│   ├── certificate/    # License generation & validation
│   ├── special_admin/  # Super-admin functions
│   ├── audit/          # Activity logging & compliance
│   └── checklist/      # Process workflows & verification
├── core/               # Shared configuration & utilities
└── db/                 # Database migrations & models
```

### Module Design Principles
1. **Clean Boundaries**: Each module has well-defined interfaces
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Modules interact through defined contracts
3. **Database Isolation**: Each module owns its data schema (logical separation)
4. **Service Interfaces**: Modules expose service interfaces for future extraction
5. **Event-Driven Communication**: Use events for loose coupling between modules

### Migration Strategy
When a module needs to become a microservice:
1. Extract the module code (already isolated)
2. Add API layer for the extracted service
3. Replace internal calls with HTTP/gRPC calls
4. Migrate data to separate database
5. Deploy as independent service

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster initial development and time to market
- Simpler operations and deployment
- Easier debugging and testing
- Better performance for module interactions
- Clear path to microservices when needed

### Negative
- Single point of failure (mitigated by good monitoring and deployment practices)
- Technology lock-in for all modules initially
- Need discipline to maintain module boundaries
- Potential scaling limitations at very high volume

### Neutral
- Will need to evolve architecture as team and system grow
- Requires good monitoring to understand when to extract services

## Compliance

This decision supports:
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Easier to ensure compliance in single codebase
- **Audit Trail**: Centralized logging and audit capabilities
- **Data Security**: Single security model and access control
- **Performance SLAs**: Better performance characteristics initially

## Review Criteria

This decision should be reviewed when:
1. Development team exceeds 8-10 people
2. Individual modules show significantly different scaling characteristics
3. Need for technology diversity becomes important
4. Operational complexity of monolith exceeds microservices complexity
