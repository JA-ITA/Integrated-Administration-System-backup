# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING: Certificate microservice (port 8006) is running with health endpoint accessible, PDF service (port 3001) is operational, storage service has local filesystem fallback, and event service has fallback storage. Main backend integration endpoints are properly configured. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Certificate service requires database connectivity for all operations and returns 503 'Database service unavailable' errors when PostgreSQL is not available. Despite having storage and event fallbacks, the service cannot generate, download, or verify certificates without database. This contradicts the expected 'degraded mode' functionality mentioned in requirements. All certificate endpoints fail with database dependency."

        comment: "✅ FIXED DATABASE DEPENDENCY ISSUE: Implemented comprehensive database fallback mechanisms. Created fallback_storage.py service for in-memory and file-based certificate metadata storage when database is unavailable. Modified all certificate routes (generate, download by ID/driver record, verify, status, get driver certificates) to work seamlessly with either database or fallback storage. Certificate service now operates in degraded mode without database, using local filesystem for file storage, in-memory events for RabbitMQ fallback, and JSON file storage for certificate metadata. Services running: Certificate (8006), PDF (3001). Health endpoint shows 'healthy' status even with database unavailable."

        comment: "✅ DATABASE FALLBACK MECHANISMS VERIFIED: Certificate microservice successfully operates in degraded mode without database connectivity. Health endpoint shows 'healthy' status despite database being unavailable. Service correctly uses fallback storage (local filesystem + in-memory) and fallback events. Fixed critical JSON serialization issue in certificate generation (lambda functions in template context). All database fallback mechanisms are working correctly - service switches seamlessly between database and fallback storage. Minor issue: PDF service has text encoding problems with newline characters, but this is a technical PDF generation issue, not a database fallback issue. The core requirement of operating without database dependency is fully satisfied."

MAIN ENDPOINT VERIFIED: GET /api/v1/certificates/{driverRecordId}/download working perfectly - generates certificates, provides download URLs, handles verification. SERVICES OPERATIONAL: Certificate service (8006) healthy, PDF service (3001) healthy with Handlebars+PDF-lib integration working. FALLBACK MODES CONFIRMED: Storage service using local filesystem fallback (MinIO unavailable), Event service using in-memory fallback (RabbitMQ unavailable), Database fallback working seamlessly. ROUTE CONFLICTS RESOLVED: Both /certificates/{driverRecordId}/download and /certificates/download/{certificateId} endpoints working without conflicts. PDF GENERATION PIPELINE: Fixed text encoding issue, now generating valid PDFs with QR codes and proper formatting. All requirements from review request satisfied - service operates in degraded mode as intended."
